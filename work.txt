autoload.php :- The autoload.php file generated by Composer is responsible for loading all the necessary classes and files needed for your Laravel application to run.

start.php :- The start.php file was used to set the environment for the application. It included logic to detect the current environment (e.g., development, testing, production) and load the corresponding configuration files.

app.php :- The app.php file in Laravel serves as a central configuration file where you register service providers, define facade aliases, set the application environment, and configure various default settings for the Laravel application.

kernel.php :- The kernel.php file in Laravel is the central location for defining the application's HTTP and console middleware, allowing you to manage and organize middleware groups, route middleware, and schedule console commands.

middleware :- Middleware in Laravel provides a mechanism to filter HTTP requests entering your application, allowing you to perform actions before and after the request reaches the route handler, such as authentication, logging, session handling, and more, thus enabling modular and reusable code to be executed at various stages of the request lifecycle.
