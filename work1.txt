Use belongsTo when the foreign key is on the current model's table, and it references the primary key of another model.
If you have a Comment model and each comment is associated with a single User, you would use belongsTo in the Comment model to establish this relationship.

Use hasMany when the foreign key is on the related model's table, and it references the primary key of the current model.
If you have a User model and each user can have multiple comments, you would use hasMany in the User model.
